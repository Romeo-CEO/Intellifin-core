 **`GLOBAL_CONSTRAINTS`**: This specifies critical non-functional requirements and limitations such as responsive design, Zambian Data Protection Act compliance (including data residency), third-party API reliability, multi-tenancy requirements, data security, UX for non-tech-savvy users, future AI scalability, team expertise, iterative development, and general Zambian context considerations.
    *   <GLOBAL_CONSTRAINTS>
        Constraint: Must be a responsive web application accessible on both desktop and mobile browsers, optimized for potentially low-bandwidth conditions common in Zambia.
        Constraint: Strict adherence to Zambian Data Protection Act is required, which has implications for data residency and cross-border data flows if using non-Zambian Azure regions (e.g., South Africa).
        Constraint: Direct integration with third-party APIs (Airtel Mobile Money, ZRA Smart Invoice) is core to the MVP; their capabilities, rate limits, and security protocols will be key design drivers.
        Multi-Tenancy: This is a foundational requirement. The "schema-per-tenant" approach with PostgreSQL needs careful design for scalability, connection management, and efficient migrations across all tenant schemas using Prisma.
        Third-Party API Reliability: The system needs to be resilient to potential unreliability or changes in the third-party Mobile Money and ZRA APIs. Robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and clear user feedback loops for integration issues are critical.
        Data Security & Compliance: Given the handling of sensitive financial data and ZRA compliance information, security best practices (secure credential management with Azure Key Vault, data encryption at rest and in transit, robust authentication/authorization) and adherence to Zambian financial data regulations (including audit trails) are paramount.
        User Experience for Non-Tech Savvy Users: The target audience may not be highly tech-literate. The UI/UX must be exceptionally intuitive and straightforward, even for complex tasks like financial reconciliation or tax submissions.
        Future Scalability for AI: While the MVP is foundational, the architecture should allow for future integration of data analytics and AI/ML services (e.g., for cash flow forecasting, credit scoring). This means considering how data will be collected, structured, and made available for these future services, potentially involving data warehousing strategies down the line.
        Team Expertise: Assume the development team has proficiency in the chosen tech stack but will need clear architectural guidance on best practices for this specific application context (fintech, multi-tenancy, African market).
        Iterative Development: The MVP is the first step. The architecture should support agile, iterative development for adding more mobile money providers, tax modules, and advanced features post-MVP.
        Zambian Context: Familiarity or research into Zambian business practices, common financial terminologies, and ZRA's specific requirements will be beneficial beyond just the technical API integrations.
